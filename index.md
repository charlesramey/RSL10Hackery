## Overview
The On Semiconductor RSL10 System on a Chip (SoC) is a really neat, _very_ low power microprocessor / RF front end combination chip. This objective of this rough page is to outline the process of getting started developing applications with the On Semiconducter RSL10 SDK and dive deeper into some of the functionalities of this chip.

## Getting to Blinky
Fortunately, the getting started PDF straight from On Semi was actually extremely comprehensive and provided pretty much step by step instructions from unboxing the SoC development board, to intalling the Eclipse based SDK, to loading the blinky example code, to finally programming the SoC board and running the blinky code on the platform. All in all, the process of unboxing the SoC to running the blinky example took less than an hour and a half.
